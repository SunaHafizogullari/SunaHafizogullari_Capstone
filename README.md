### Leveraging Student Information to Enhance College Persistence

Suna Hafizogullari

#### Executive summary
10,000 Degrees is dedicated to empowering students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to succeed in college through comprehensive support and scholarship opportunities. With a remarkable four-year college graduation rate of 80%, significantly higher than the national average of 31%, the organization has demonstrated a proven track record of success. This study sheds light on the data collected from participants in 10,000 Degrees programs, obtained through the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), to further deepen our understanding of the organization's impact.

The purpose of this study is to pinpoint the students who face an increased likelihood of leaving college, uncover the underlying factors that contribute to their decision, and furnish 10,000 Degrees with actionable insights to intervene before student attrition takes place. 

#### Rationale
Education equity is a foundation for strengthening the economic vitality and social health of all communities. By furnishing 10,000 Degrees with data-driven insights, we can aid the organization in its efforts to proactively identify and support at-risk students.

#### Research Question
The main objectives of this research are to:

- Determine the key factors that influence a student's ability to persist and return to college in the subsequent fall after initial enrollment following high school graduation.
- Identify the student population that is at risk of not continuing their studies."

#### Data Sources
10,000 Degrees provided the data obtained through the NSC. High school ratings were obtained from greatschools.org website.

#### Methodology
Classification techniques were employed to determine the students who are facing obstacles in their academic journey and the specific factors that are hindering their success.

#### Results
Our research has revealed that students attending two-year colleges, despite being supported by the 10,000 Degrees program, are at a higher risk of dropping out (24%). To analyze the data more effectively, we divided it into two segments: one for students enrolled in two-year colleges and the other for those attending four-year colleges.

<u>Findings for the students attending two-year colleges</u>:

Several key factors were identified as having a significant impact on a student's likelihood of persisting in the program if they are attending a two-year college, including:
- A strong desire to transfer to a four-year college
- Receiving scholarships
- Having attended high school in more affluent regions in the Bay Area

The model for the two-year college students predicts 60% of the students who dropped-out within the bottom 20% of students who persisted.

<u>Findings for the students attending four-year colleges</u>:

Students who receive scholarships, attended high school more recently, and belong to certain racial groups are more likely to persist in four-year colleges, with a drop-out rate of only 5.5%.

Upon reviewing these findings with 10,000 Degrees, there may be opportunities to refine the models and further improve their accuracy. We need to look for options for other available data sources.
